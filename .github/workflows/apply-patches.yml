# The action fetches code from the PR's source branch, takes the target branch, and tries to fetch and apply patches using PR's target branch.
# E.g. if a PR targets a version branch `3.20`, the action would checkout to `3.20` branch in the patches repo and try to apply patches from that branch.
# If patches apply, the action succeeds, otherwise it returns an error, and indicates that patches need to be adjusted.
# - Action runs on all branches
# - Action can be skipped with label: `skip check patches`
